Mask R-CNN with Detectron2 for Instance Segmentation

This repository demonstrates the use of Detectron2 for implementing Mask R-CNN to perform object detection and instance segmentation. Detectron2 is a powerful and flexible deep learning framework for computer vision tasks developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR).

Overview

This notebook leverages the Mask R-CNN model from the Detectron2 library to detect objects and generate segmentation masks for each object in an image. Mask R-CNN is widely used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks, allowing pixel-level understanding of objects in a given image.

Key objectives of this project:

	•	Use pre-trained Mask R-CNN from the Detectron2 library.
	•	Run inference on images to detect objects and generate segmentation masks.
	•	Visualize results with bounding boxes, class labels, and masks.
	•	Optionally fine-tune the model on a custom dataset.

What’s Included

The repository consists of the following components:

	1.	Detectron2 Mask R-CNN Notebook:
	•	Step-by-step implementation of Mask R-CNN using Detectron2.
	•	Code to load the pre-trained model, process images, and generate object detection and segmentation masks.
	2.	Sample Images:
	•	A few example images on which the Mask R-CNN model has been applied to demonstrate object detection and segmentation results.
	3.	Visualization:
	•	Visualization of bounding boxes, masks, and class labels over the detected objects in the images.

Features

	•	Object Detection: The model detects and classifies objects in an image with bounding boxes and labels.
	•	Instance Segmentation: The model generates pixel-level binary masks for each detected object.
	•	High Performance: Detectron2’s efficient implementation allows fast and accurate inference on large images and datasets.
	•	Pre-trained Models: Leverage pre-trained models trained on the COCO dataset for a variety of object categories.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Detectron2
	•	OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization

Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository:
!git clone https://github.com/your_username/detectron2-mask-rcnn-demo.git
cd detectron2-mask-rcnn-demo

2.	Install Dependencies:

To install the required libraries, run:
!pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	Download Pre-Trained Weights:
The notebook uses pre-trained weights for Mask R-CNN from the Detectron2 Model Zoo. These will be automatically downloaded when running the notebook.
Usage

	1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:
 jupyter notebook detectron2_mask_rcnn_demo.ipynb

 2.	Run the Model on Sample Images:
The notebook walks through the steps of loading images, applying the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model, and visualizing the results.
	3.	Visualizing Detections:
After running the model, bounding boxes, class labels, and segmentation masks will be overlaid on the input images to show the model’s predictions.

Fine-Tuning (Optional)

This notebook demonstrates inference using a pre-trained model, but Detectron2 also allows easy fine-tuning for specific use cases. You can customize the Mask R-CNN model for your dataset by:

	•	Modifying the dataset and loader
	•	Adjusting the model’s hyperparameters for training
	•	Fine-tuning on your custom dataset

How to Fine-Tune:

	1.	Prepare a dataset in COCO format.
	2.	Load the dataset and modify the config file for fine-tuning.
	3.	Use Detectron2’s training utilities to train the model.

Performance Evaluation (Optional)

Detectron2 allows evaluation of model performance using various metrics, including:

	•	Intersection over Union (IoU) for segmentation masks.
	•	Precision/Recall for object detection.
